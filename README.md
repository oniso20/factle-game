# Factle Game Project

Factle is a new Wordle spin-off that asks users to solve a daily fact based challenge, such as which songs on Spotify have been streamed the most, what country has won the world cup the most. Users must then pick the top five answers and have six chances to make their guesses.

The game is developed to help users learn new facts, try their knowledge on current facts in a fun way.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

CD to client folder or server before running available scripts

### `npm install`

Installs and check for dependencies.

### `npm run start:frontend`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run start:backend`

The json-server serving the test data is fired when this command is run. The json-data will be hosted on localhost:4200 as React will already be using localhost 3000.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
